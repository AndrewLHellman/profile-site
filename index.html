            <h2>Mornings</h2>
            <p>Mornings suck. Because of this, nothing is more helpful to making sure I get things done than having a set time to wake up, and a set time for my first thing of the day. For me, an 8am is a pain, but so is a 9am and so is a 10am. The difference is that with an 8am as my first class, I gain an extra 2 hours. Mornings suck anyways, give yourself less morning. Mornings don't suck because of the time of day, they suck because your brain hasn't had to do anything yet. Make it.</p>

            <h2>Hard</h2>
            <p>Things are hard, and that's okay. Programming is hard, math is hard, music is hard, acting is hard, dancing is hard. It's okay to struggle with these things. The fact that you're here still trying to learn them is better than you could possible ask for. You can do them, you are doing them. You definitely don't need to do them, and certainly not all, but you want to and that's why you're here.</p>
